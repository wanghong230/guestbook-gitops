# guestbook-gitops

GitOps repo to deploy `quay.io/guestbook` to three environments across two
clusters using Argo CD for sync and Kargo for promotion.

```

## Promotion template

The three Stages share a single `PromotionTask` (`kargo/promotion-tasks/kustomize-promote.yaml`)
rather than each carrying its own copy of the steps. The task uses
`${{ ctx.stage }}` to pick the matching overlay
(`apps/guestbook/overlays/${{ ctx.stage }}`) and Argo CD app
(`guestbook-${{ ctx.stage }}`), so each `Stage` resource only has to declare
its upstream Freight source — the step list collapses to:

```yaml
promotionTemplate:
  spec:
    steps:
      - task:
          name: kustomize-promote
```

To override the repo URL or image for one Stage, pass step-level vars on the
task reference (see the Promotion Tasks reference for syntax).

## Replica-cap validation (Kyverno)

The promotion task renders the overlay with `kustomize-build` and then runs a
custom step (`kyverno-validate`) that invokes the Kyverno CLI against
`policies/guestbook-max-replicas.yaml`. The policy carries one rule per Stage
namespace:

| Stage     | Namespace          | Max replicas |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------|
| dev       | guestbook-dev      | 20           |
| staging   | guestbook-staging  | 20           |
| prod      | guestbook-prod     | 100          |

If the rendered Deployment violates the cap, Kyverno exits non-zero, the
custom step fails, and the promotion stops **before** anything is committed,
pushed, or synced — the bad replica count never reaches the cluster.

Requirements (per the Kargo docs):

- `CustomPromotionStep` is an **Akuity Platform (Kargo EE) v1.10+** feature,
  currently alpha.
- The Promotion Controller and a self-hosted agent must be enabled.
- `kargo/custom-steps/kyverno-validate.yaml` is **cluster-scoped** — a Kargo
  cluster admin must apply it once.

To change a cap, edit `policies/guestbook-max-replicas.yaml` directly. To add
another check (image registry allowlist, resource limits, etc.), add a rule
to the same file or a sibling policy under `policies/`.

## Cluster topology

| Stage     | Argo CD cluster name | Namespace          |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------|
| dev       | local-nonprod        | guestbook-dev      |
| staging   | local-nonprod        | guestbook-staging  |
| prod      | local-prod           | guestbook-prod     |

## Promotion flow

1. CI pushes a new immutable tag (e.g. `v1.4.2`) to `quay.io/guestbook`.
2. Kargo's `Warehouse` discovers the tag and produces new Freight.
3. The `dev` Stage auto-promotes (per `promotionPolicies` in `kargo/project.yaml`):
   it clones the repo, runs `kustomize edit set image` against
   `apps/guestbook/overlays/dev`, commits, pushes, and tells Argo CD to sync
   `guestbook-dev`.
4. After dev verification, you (or an automated check) promote that Freight to
   `staging` — same pattern, against the staging overlay.
5. Same for `prod`, which targets the `local-prod` cluster.

Each Stage only accepts Freight from the prior stage, so you can't skip
straight from a fresh image to prod.

## Bootstrap

Replace every `REPLACE_ME` / `REPLACE-WITH-...` placeholder first, then:

```bash
# 1. Argo CD: project, cluster Secrets, Applications
kubectl apply -f argocd/projects/
kubectl apply -f argocd/clusters/
kubectl apply -f argocd/applications/

# 2. Kargo cluster admin (one-time): register the custom step
kubectl apply -f kargo/custom-steps/

# 3. Kargo project: git creds, warehouse, promotion task, stages
kubectl apply -f kargo/project.yaml
kubectl apply -f kargo/warehouse.yaml
kubectl apply -f kargo/promotion-tasks/
kubectl apply -f kargo/stages/
```

Placeholders to fill:
- `argocd/clusters/*-secret.yaml` — API server URL, bearer token, CA bundle.
- `argocd/applications/*.yaml` — `spec.source.repoURL` (your fork of this repo).
- `kargo/project.yaml` — git PAT under `gitops-repo-creds`, plus `repoURL`.
- `kargo/warehouse.yaml` and `kargo/promotion-tasks/kustomize-promote.yaml` —
  `repoURL` defaults (same value across the file).

## Testing the manifests locally

```bash
kubectl kustomize apps/guestbook/overlays/dev
kubectl kustomize apps/guestbook/overlays/staging
kubectl kustomize apps/guestbook/overlays/prod

# Dry-run the same Kyverno check the promotion will run
for env in dev staging prod; do
  kubectl kustomize apps/guestbook/overlays/$env > /tmp/rendered-$env.yaml
  kyverno apply policies/guestbook-max-replicas.yaml --resource /tmp/rendered-$env.yaml
done
```

## Notes

- Overlays pin `quay.io/guestbook:latest` only as a starting point. Kargo
  rewrites `images[0].newTag` on each promotion, so the in-tree value drifts
  to the most recently promoted tag for each environment.
- `dev` is set to auto-promote; `staging` and `prod` require an explicit
  promotion (a `Promotion` resource, the Kargo UI button, or `kargo promote`).
- Each Argo CD `Application` carries `kargo.akuity.io/authorized-stage` so
  only the corresponding Stage can drive it.
